[HashiCorp Boundary](https://www.boundaryproject.io) enables simple and secure access to dynamic infrastructure by:

- **Identity-based access controls:** Streamline just-in-time access to privileged sessions (e.g. TCP, SSH, RDP) for users and applications. Tightly control access permissions with extensible role-based access controls.

- **Access Automation:** Define your perimeter of resources, identities, and access controls as code through Boundary's fully-instrumented Terraform Provider, REST API, CLI, and SDK. Automate the discovery of new resources and enforcement of existing policies as resources are provisioned.

- **Session Visibility:** Security administrators gain monitor and managed the privileged sessions established with Boundary. Export session logs to your analytics tool of choice.
