Boundary can run in a **dev mode** which is an all-in-one installation method for getting started with Boundary quickly. The dev mode is not a production installation but useful for experiment with Boundary locally.

Boundary dev mode starts:

- A controller server
- A worker server
- A Postgres database


Check the help message for `boundary dev` command.

```
boundary dev -h
```{{execute}}

There are a number of optional parameters available, but for now, start a dev server with default configurations.

```
boundary dev -api-listen-address=0.0.0.0:9200
```{{execute}}


**Example output:**

```
