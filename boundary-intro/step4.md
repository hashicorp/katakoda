In the **Terminal 2**, view the help message for `boundary authenticate` command.

```
boundary authenticate help
```{{execute T2}}

Authenticate with Boundary.

```
boundary authenticate password -auth-method-id=ampw_1234567890 \
      -login-name=admin -password=password \
      -keyring-type=none -format=json | jq -r ".token" > boundary_token.txt
```{{execute T2}}

The output suggests that token must be provided via `BOUNDARY_TOKEN` env var or `-token` flag.

```
Error opening keyring: Specified keyring backend not available
Token must be provided via BOUNDARY_TOKEN env var or -token flag. Reading the token can also be disabled via -keyring-type=none.
```

Set the `BOUNDARY_TOKEN` environment variable.  

```
export BOUNDARY_TOKEN=$(cat boundary_token.txt)
```{{execute T2}}

Read the details about the Generated target by its target ID which is `ttcp_1234567890`.

```
boundary targets read -id ttcp_1234567890
```{{execute T2}}

Use the `boundary connect` command to SSH into the `localhost`.

```
boundary connect ssh -target-id ttcp_1234567890
```{{execute T2}}

Return to the first **Terminal** to view the Boundary server log.

Open a **new terminal**, and list current sessions.

```
boundary sessions list -scope-id=p_1234567890 \
    -token $(cat boundary_token.txt)
```{{execute T3}}

**Example output:**

```
Session information:
  ID:                 s_XJmV49qjVM
    Status:           active
    Created Time:     Wed, 28 Oct 2020 21:31:15 UTC
    Expiration Time:  Thu, 29 Oct 2020 05:31:15 UTC
    Updated Time:     Wed, 28 Oct 2020 21:31:15 UTC
    User ID:          u_1234567890
    Target ID:        ttcp_1234567890
```

The `ID` should match to what you saw in the Boundary server log (e.g. `session activated: session_id=s_XJmV49qjVM`).

Return to **Terminal 2** and exit out of the SSH session.

```
exit
```{{execute T2}}

A message, "Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed" displays.

Verify that the session is terminated.

```
boundary sessions list -scope-id=p_1234567890
```{{execute T2}}

The output should show the session status to be `terminated`.

## Exec command

The `boundary connect` can execute clients even when there is no built-in wrapper subcommand for it using `-exec`. The `-exec` flag is a very powerful tool, allowing you to wrap Boundary TCP sessions in your preferred client. You can use this flag to create an authenticated proxy to almost anything.


Let's update the default TCP target (`ttcp_1234567890`) port from `22` to `443` using the `boundary targets update` command.

```
boundary targets update tcp -default-port 443 -id ttcp_1234567890
```{{execute T2}}

Execute the cURL command using the `-exec` flag.

```
boundary connect -exec curl -target-id ttcp_1234567890 \
     -- -vvsL --output /dev/null hashicorp.com
```{{execute T2}}
