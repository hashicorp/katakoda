# Build a Module

This Katacoda scenario is meant to serve as a companion piece for the 
[Build a Module](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/module-use?in=terraform/modules)
Terraform Learn tutorial.

In this scenario, you will create a module to manage AWS S3 buckets used to host static websites.

> This environment has been pre-configured with the Terraform CLI, AWS CLI and 
[localstack](https://localstack.cloud/), a mocking framework that mocks core 
AWS APIs locally. As a result, you do not need an AWS account to complete this scenario.
