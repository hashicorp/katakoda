Developing Sentinel policies that express capabilities with the least privilege
enforcement requires testing the policies. The Sentinel Simulator allows you to
test EGPs and RGPs offline without a Vault server.

In this scenario, you are given an environment consisting of the Sentinel
Simulator and an example EGP with tests. The tests contain a flaw and it is
your job to identify and correct the flaw so that all tests pass.
