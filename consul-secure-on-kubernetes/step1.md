First, install an unsecured Consul service mesh in a Kubernetes cluster.

### Download Helm repo

Click the box below to download the Helm repo:

`helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com`{{execute T1}}

### Review and apply a basic config file

Review the `dc1.yaml`{{open}} file. The chart will start the consul clients
and servers and provision a persistent disk. The install may take a minute
or two to complete.

`helm install -f ./dc1.yaml katacoda hashicorp/consul --wait`{{execute T1}}

You should receive output similar to the following:

```plaintext
NAME: katacoda
...omitted
  $ helm get all katacoda
```

### Verify installation

Verify the installation using the following command:

`watch kubectl get pods`{{execute T1}}

Once all pods have a status of `Running` the installation is complete.
