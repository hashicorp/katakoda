# Use Modules from the Registry

This Katacoda scenario is meant to serve as a companion piece for the 
[Use Modules from the Registry](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/module-use?in=terraform/modules)
Terraform Learn tutorial.

In this scenario, you will use modules from the Terraform Registry to provision 
an example environment on AWS. The concepts you use in this scenario will apply 
to any modules from any source.

> This environment has been pre-configured with the Terraform CLI and 
[localstack](https://localstack.cloud/),  a mocking framework that mocks core 
AWS APIs locally. As a result, you do not need an AWS account to complete this scenario.
