Like resources, you can destroy resources provisioned using modules using 
`terraform destroy`.

Run `terraform destroy`{{execute}} to destroy the VPC and EC2 modules provisioned
in this scenario.

After you respond to the prompt with `yes`{{execute}}, Terraform will destroy 
the infrastructure you created.
