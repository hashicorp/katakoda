Compare the code in `cidr-check.sentinel` and the test data in `success.json` in the editor windows. 

First, open `workshop-one/cidr-check.sentinel`{{open}} in the editor so that you can examine the code.

Then open `workshop-one/test/cidr-check/success.json`{{open}} and update it so that the tests will all pass.

When you have updated the policy, test it again.

```shell
sentinel test
```{{execute}}
