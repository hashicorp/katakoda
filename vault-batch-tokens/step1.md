Login with root token.

```
vault login root
```{{execute T1}}

To create a batch token, you need to explicitly set the token type to be `batch`.

Execute the following command:

```
vault token create -type="batch"
```{{execute T1}}

Currently, you are logged in with `root` token; therefore, the child token inherits its creator's policy in absence of `-policy` flag.

```

* batch tokens cannot be root tokens
```

Batch tokens **cannot** be root tokens.  `clear`{{execute T1}}


Let's create a policy named, `test`.

```
vault policy write test test.hcl
```{{execute T1}}

To review the created policy:

```
vault policy read test
```{{execute T1}}


Now, create a batch token with a non-root policy attached and save it to the `token.txt` file:

```
vault token create -type=batch -policy=test -ttl=20m \
      | jq -r ".auth.client_token" > token.txt
```{{execute T1}}

Notice that the generated token value is much longer than the service tokens
(`token.txt`{{open}}). This is because batch tokens are encrypted by the Vault's
barrier.

Let's view the generated batch token's properties:

```
vault token lookup $(cat token.txt)
```{{execute T1}}

The output look similar to the following:

```

```

Notice that the **type** is **batch**, and it does not have a token accessor. Also, the **renewable** parameter is set to `false` since batch tokens are NOT renewable.
