Click the **+** next to the opened Terminal, and select **Open New Terminal** to start fifth terminal (**Terminal 5**).

Open the `node3` server configuration file, `config-node3.hcl`{{open}}.

```
storage "raft" {
  path    = "/home/scrapbook/tutorial/raft-node3/"
  node_id = "node3"

  retry_join {
    leader_api_addr = "http://127.0.0.1:8200"
  }

  retry_join {
    leader_api_addr = "http://127.0.0.1:2200"
  }
}

...
```

Notice that the `node_id` is set to `node3` and this server will listen to port **`3200`**.

Inside the **storage** stanza, two-sets of **`retry_join`** parameters are defined. One points to the `node1` API address (`http://127.0.0.1:8200`), and another points to the `node2` API address (`http://127.0.0.1:2200`). If the connection details of all nodes are known beforehand, configure the `retry_join` so that the node will automatically join the raft cluster upon start up.


Execute the following command to start `node3`:

```
mkdir raft-node3
vault server -config=config-node3.hcl -log-level=debug
```{{execute T5}}

```
==> Vault server configuration:

             Api Address: http://127.0.0.1:3200
                     Cgo: disabled
         Cluster Address: https://127.0.0.1:3201
              Listener 1: tcp (addr: "127.0.0.1:3200", cluster address: "127.0.0.1:3201", max_request_duration: "1m30s", max_request_size: "33554432", tls: "disabled")
               Log Level: info
                   Mlock: supported: true, enabled: false
           Recovery Mode: false
                 Storage: raft (HA available)
                 Version: Vault v1.5.3

==> Vault server started! Log data will stream in below:
```

You can verify that the **Api Address** is `http://127.0.0.1:3200`.  

Find the following messages:

```
[INFO]  core: raft retry join initiated
...
[INFO]  core: attempting to join possible raft leader node: leader_addr=http://127.0.0.1:8200
[INFO]  core: join attempt failed: error="waiting for unseal keys to be supplied"
...
```

In order to complete the joining operation, `node3` must be unsealed.

<br />

## Unseal the Cluster

Click the **+** next to the opened Terminal, and select **Open New Terminal** to start sixth terminal (**Terminal 6**).

In **Terminal 6**, set the VAULT_ADDR to `http://127.0.0.1:3200`.

```
export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:3200'
```{{execute T6}}

Unseal `node3` using the unseal key generated by the **active** server (`node1`).

```
vault operator unseal $(grep 'Key 1:' key.txt | awk '{print $NF}')
```{{execute T6}}


In **Terminal 5**, you should find the following messages in the server log:

```
...
[DEBUG] core: unseal key supplied
[INFO]  core: security barrier not initialized
[INFO]  core: waiting for raft retry join process to complete
[INFO]  core: security barrier not initialized
[INFO]  core: attempting to join possible raft leader node: leader_addr=http://127.0.0.1:8200
...
[INFO]  core: successfully joined the raft cluster: leader_addr=http://127.0.0.1:8200
[INFO]  storage.raft: entering follower state: follower="Node at 127.0.0.1:3201 [Follower]" leader=
...
[INFO]  core: vault is unsealed
[INFO]  core: entering standby mode
...
```

Once Vault is unsealed, you can login using the root token.

```
vault login $(grep 'Initial Root Token:' key.txt | awk '{print $NF}')
```{{execute T6}}

Check the Raft cluster configuration.

```
vault operator raft list-peers
```{{execute T6}}

```
Node     Address           State       Voter
----     -------           -----       -----
node1    127.0.0.1:8201    leader      true
node2    127.0.0.1:2201    follower    true
node3    127.0.0.1:3201    follower    true
```

You should see `node1`, `node2` and `node3` listed.
