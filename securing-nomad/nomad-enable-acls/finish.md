To recap, while completing this scenario you:

- learned the core ACL objects

- bootstrapped the ACL subsystem

- installed an anonymous policy

- learned about policy design

- crafted a policy for two separate user personas

- created those policies on the Nomad cluster

- created tokens based on those policies

- validated that your policies worked as expected through testing using those
  tokens
