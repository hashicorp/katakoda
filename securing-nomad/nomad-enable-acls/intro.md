The ACL system is designed to be intuitive, high-performance, and to provide
administrative insight. At the highest level, there are three major components
to the ACL system: tokens, policies, and rules which encapsulate policy 
dispositions and capabilities. The components are illustrated in the diagram 
below.

![ACL Tokens refer to one or more related policies. ACL Policies contain one or
many rules. Rules contain one policy disposition and, for certain resources,
fine grained capabilities.](./assets/acl.jpg)

This scenario begins with a cluster that has:

- 3 servers and 1 client
- gossip encryption configured
- mTLS configured
