HashiCorp Consul Service (HCS) on Azure enables Microsoft Azure users to natively
provision HashiCorp-managed Consul servers in any supported Azure region directly
through the Azure Marketplace. As a fully managed service, HCS on Azure lowers the
barrier to entry for an organization to leverage Consul for service discovery or
service mesh across a mix of VM, hybrid/on-premises, and Kubernetes environments
while offloading the operational burden to the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
experts at HashiCorp.

In this hands-on lab, you:

- Configured a development environment to manage HashiCorp Consul Service on Azure.
- Secured communications between your HCS datacenter and your AKS cluster.
- Deployed a demo application to AKS.
- Deployed an Ingress Gateway to HCS to enable external traffic to your application.
